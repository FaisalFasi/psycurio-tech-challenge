# psycurio-tech-challenge

This project is made with Unity version 2018.4.21.

To run this project you have to open project and under the Assets/Scenes folder you will find a MainMenu Scene. 
Please open and run this scene. Make sure you have added all the scenes under Assets/Scenes folder in the build settings.

When you will play the MainMenu scene you will see 3 buttons. I named them according to your given tasks names. 
By clicking each button you will enter in a different scene and there you can check the tasks performed by me.

you can find all the relevent scripts under folder Assets/Scripts. Same for the 3D-Models you can find them under folder Assets/Models.
